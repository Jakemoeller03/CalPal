README:

CalPal is a calorie tracking application that takes the user's age, weight, and height into consideration and utilizes it to create a daily caloric intake for the user. Users can track macros and monitor their caloric intake based on their goal in mind.

When starting up the app, you are prompted with entering your user information (Name, age, weight, height). You then can create a plan based on what goal you had in mind(Lose weight, gain weight, build muscle, maintain weight). From there you can add meal entries and their macros(Calories, protein, carbs, sugar, fat). You can add favorite these meals, add them to your daily caloric intake, and reset for the next day.
